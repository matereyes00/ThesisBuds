  <title>PHILIPPINES: Admin Level 4 Boundaries</title>
  <abstract>This dataset contains the indicative boundaries of the Barangays as observed at the end of June 2016 as per the Philippine Geographic Standard Code (PSGC) dataset. It has been generated on the basis of the layer created by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) in the context of the 2015 population census.

This dataset has been prepared for the purpose of Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) in the Philippines.

To facilitate data compatibility among sources, the original PSGC code has been modified by adding a "PH" in the attribute table of the GIS layer.</abstract>

  <history>Thanks to the support of UN OCHA, the SIIEM project, PSA, NAMRIA, DOST/NOAH and DSWD, the original layer has been cleaned and adjusted to match the data specification set by the NDRRMC Information Management Technical Working Group (IM-TWG) as well as NAMRIA's 1:250'000 indicative. The layer was downloaded as a shapefile by ITOS from HDX. It was then analyzed by ITOS for errors. Those errors were corrected and then the layer was sent back to UNOCHA as a feature class within a file geodatabase. The following errors were found and fixed by ITOS: 1. Created and populated a reference name field. 2. Created and populated Admin0 name and p-code fields. 3. ALL CAPS names were converted to Proper Case. 4. Removed names in parentheses from the admin parent names. The IMO has instructed ITOS to separate names in parentheses from the non-parenthetical names in Admin1-3. 5. Donut holes for lakes that are not portions of boundaries have been removed 6. Fixed 40 overlap errors and 4 gap errors 7. Fixed 905 multipart sliver errors 8. 22 Admin4 p-codes were blank. The IMO has provided values for missing pcodes in Excel document "171003_Philippines_Suggestedpcodes_admin4_missing.xls". ITOS has populated the blank p-codes with the values from the Excel sheet 9. 2 Admin4 units named "Unclaimed Area under Jurisdiction of Zamboanga City" existed in Admin3 "Zamboanga City". The IMO instructed ITOS to make "Unclaimed Area under Jurisdiction of Zamboanga City" one multipart feature 10, The small portion was removed from admin4 "Nagsurot" and merged with admin4 "Baruyen". 11. As instructed by UNOCHA, Admin4 units in Admin1 "Negros Island Region" have had their attribution altered: -Units with Admin2 p-code portion "PH1845" have been changed to "PH0645". The Admin1 p-codes were changed to "PH060000000" and their Admin1 name changed to “Region VI”. -Units with Admin2 p-code portion "PH1846" have been changed to "PH0746". The Admin1 p-codes were changed to "PH070000000" and their Admin1 name changed to “Region VII”.</history>
